How does it work

# step 1: when you copy a pinyin word below

Example: nǐ or hǎo

# step 2: run the script

![example1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21117852/34506778-cd747ba8-f06a-11e7-9e7d-8b6c3dfa59d1.png)


the program will search the word then replacing the special tone mark "nǐ" with
a normal character like "ni".

# step 3: paste into Anki card or text editor

![example2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21117852/34507407-929e8590-f070-11e7-888c-2829880f6284.png)

Make sure it worked by opening a text editor and paste the result.

Example: [sound:ni3.mp3] or [sound:hao3.mp3]

If you have see this it's ready to paste into an Anki card to be played.

# step 4: copy all the pinyin sound files into your Anki media folder

![example3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21117852/34507587-7d0d1e6a-f072-11e7-842e-34afd866bc39.png)

Mac OS
Example: /Users/mymac/Library/Application Support/Anki2/bob/collection.media/

The pinyin sounds can be found in the pinyin directory
Note: you must copy the files not the folder because Anki can
only read the files and won't see the folder.
